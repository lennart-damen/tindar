# Tindar: end-to-end Operations Research

Welcome to the Tindar project: the new fictional dating app for Data Scientists!
In the Tindar app, Data Scientists have expressed their binary interest in each other.
Our job is to make the Tindar community happy by pairing up as many users as possible.

In this project we explore how to develop an end-to-end solution to this problem.
There are three parts to this project:

1. the Tindar model: how to find the optimal pairing-solution?
2. the Tindar game: can you beat the algorithm?
3. Tindar in real-life: deployment

Done:
- The Tindar model
- The Tindar game
    - using OOP to solve games
    - using OOP to generate games

To do:
- The Tindar game
    - User Interface with Dash
- Tindar in real-life with Google Cloud Platform and Flask
    - Model API: game generation and solving
    - User Interface deployed
