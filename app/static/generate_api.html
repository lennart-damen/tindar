  <h1>The Tindar API</h1>
  <!-- API Concept -->
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; padding: 2%; vertical-align:top; border:solid">
    <h2>API Concept</h2>
    <p>
        The API allows you to do two things:
        <ul>
            <li>Generate Tindar problems</li>
            <li>Solve tindar problems</li>
        </ul>

        A Tindar problem is defined by a number of people and their interest
        in each other. The graph of people and their interests is represented by a square matrix, where
        a 1 represents "interested" and a 0 "not interested" (the diagonal is filled with zeros).
        Similarly, a Tindar solution is represented by a symmetric matrix where a 1 represents "matched"
        and a 0 "not matched"<br><br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Generate -->
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; padding: 2%; vertical-align:top; border:solid">
    <h2>Generate Tindar problems</h2>
    <p>
        Because we do not really own a Tindar company with Tindar data, we will generate it randomly using
        a Bernouilli distribution<br><br>


        You can control the number of people by the parameter "n" (integer) and the number of ones with
        "connectedness" (float between 1 and 10). Make a GET request to .../api/generate with these
        parameters as a querystring, like so:<br><br>

        .../api/generate?n=20&connectedness=4<br><br>

        You will then receive back a JSON file, similar to:<br>
        {
            <pre>"n": 10,</pre>
            <pre>"connectedness": 4,</pre>
            <pre>"p": 0.367,</pre>
            <pre>"love_matrix": [</pre>
            <pre><pre>[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[...]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre>]</pre>
        }
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Solve -->
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; padding: 2%; vertical-align:top; border:solid">
    <h2>Solve Tindar problems</h2>
    <p>
        You can solve a Tindar problem by making a POST request with your Tindar problem as JSON.
        For the solution method, choose between "pulp" (which uses the BiLP formulation and solves
        to optimality) and "heuristic" (a faster heuristic which I use a baseline performance
        comparison). The JSON file should have these two keys, like so:<br>
        {
            <pre>"solver": "pulp"</pre>
            <pre>"love_matrix": [</pre>
            <pre><pre>[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[...]</pre></pre>
            <pre><pre>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]</pre></pre>
            <pre>]</pre>
        }<br><br>

        You will receive back a similar JSON file, with the keys "people_paired", which is the total
        number of people who were coupled, and "solution", which states who was coupled to whom.
